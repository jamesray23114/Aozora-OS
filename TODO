refactoring: jan 2021
[ ] refactering and optimization
[ ] move small / common c files to headers file

    - [x] macros should be all uppercase
    - [ ] function like macros should start with _
    - [x] remove global variables of anything that isnt a static memory location, global variables in .c files are ok.
